# üîß Ghost Job Detector - Database Troubleshooting Plan

## üîç CURRENT ISSUE DIAGNOSIS

**Problem**: Frontend works locally, but database writes aren't persisting to Neon PostgreSQL
**Evidence**: 
- Frontend shows 13 analyses in regular session
- Incognito/new browser shows 0 analyses 
- Neon database is completely empty
- All 3 databases are created and connected

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE: API Deployment Issues

The API endpoints are not properly deployed to Vercel because:
1. ES Module imports (`import/export`) need proper configuration
2. Missing TypeScript compilation for some files
3. API routes may not be properly built

## üõ†Ô∏è STEP-BY-STEP FIX

### Step 1: Fix API File Extensions
Vercel API routes need `.js` extensions, but our TypeScript imports are causing issues.

### Step 2: Test API Endpoints Directly
Check if `/api/analyze` is actually working in production.

### Step 3: Fix Database Connection
Ensure environment variables are properly set in Vercel.

### Step 4: Add Debugging
Add console logs to see what's happening.

## üîç IMMEDIATE TESTS TO RUN

1. **Test API Endpoint**: `curl https://your-domain/api/analyze`
2. **Check Vercel Logs**: Function logs for errors
3. **Test Database Direct**: Connect to Neon and run queries
4. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure all vars are set in Vercel

## üìù DEBUGGING PLAN

1. Add console.log statements to API endpoints
2. Test local vs production behavior
3. Check Vercel function logs
4. Verify database connections
5. Test queue processing workers
