# Content Classification Implementation Plan

**Document Version**: v1.0  
**Date**: September 7, 2025  
**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Target Integration**: WebLLM v0.1.8+ System  

---

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a robust content classification system to detect non-job content and validate job posting authenticity. The system will operate as a multi-tier validation framework integrating with the existing WebLLM infrastructure to provide comprehensive content analysis and classification.

**Key Objectives:**
- Distinguish job postings from other content types with 90%+ accuracy
- Detect expired/inactive job postings automatically  
- Validate URL accessibility and content integrity
- Implement ML-based content quality assessment
- Integrate seamlessly with existing WebLLM validation pipeline

---

## 1. Multi-Tier Validation Strategy

### Tier 1: URL Analysis & Accessibility Validation

**Primary Functions:**
- URL format validation and normalization
- HTTP/HTTPS accessibility checking with timeout handling
- Content-Type header analysis (text/html, application/pdf, etc.)
- Response code analysis (200, 301, 404, 403, etc.)
- Basic robot.txt compliance checking

**Implementation Approach:**
```typescript
interface URLValidationResult {
  isAccessible: boolean;
  contentType: string;
  responseCode: number;
  redirectChain: string[];
  contentLength: number;
  serverHeaders: Record<string, string>;
  robotsTxtAllowed: boolean;
  validationTimestamp: Date;
  confidence: number;
}
```

**Integration Points:**
- Extends existing `ValidationInput` interface in `src/agents/validator.ts`
- Leverages URL pattern extraction from `PDFURLDetector.ts`
- Integrates with `DataValidator.ts` scoring system

### Tier 2: Content Type Classification

**Content Categories:**
1. **Job Posting Content** (target content)
   - Job descriptions with clear role definitions
   - Company information and contact details  
   - Application instructions and requirements
   - Salary/compensation information

2. **Non-Job Content** (filtered out)
   - Company general information pages
   - Product/service marketing pages
   - Blog posts and news articles
   - Login/registration pages
   - Error pages and maintenance notices

3. **Ambiguous Content** (requires additional validation)
   - Career pages without specific postings
   - Company culture/values pages
   - General "we're hiring" announcements

**PLAN_UNCERTAINTY**: The boundary between "general career pages" and "specific job postings" may require extensive training data to classify accurately. Initial implementation should err on the side of including borderline content for manual review.

**Detection Strategies:**
```typescript
interface ContentClassification {
  primaryCategory: 'job_posting' | 'non_job' | 'ambiguous';
  confidence: number;
  indicators: {
    jobTitlePresent: boolean;
    companyInfoPresent: boolean;
    applicationInstructions: boolean;
    requirementsSection: boolean;
    compensationMentioned: boolean;
    postingDateFound: boolean;
  };
  riskFactors: string[];
  validationMethod: 'webllm' | 'pattern_matching' | 'hybrid';
}
```

### Tier 3: Job-Specific Validation & Quality Assessment

**Job Posting Validity Indicators:**
- **Structural Elements**: Title, company, description, location, requirements
- **Content Quality**: Description length (150+ words), specific requirements, clear responsibilities
- **Company Legitimacy**: Valid company domain, professional email addresses, established online presence
- **Posting Freshness**: Posted date within reasonable timeframe, not expired

**Pattern Recognition System:**
- Extends existing `TextPatternStrategy` from `src/services/parsing/strategies/`
- Integrates with `CompanyVerificationService` and `RepostingDetectionService`
- Leverages WebLLM for advanced content analysis

## 2. Machine Learning Approaches for Content Classification

### Feature Engineering Framework

**Text-Based Features:**
- **TF-IDF Vectors**: Term frequency analysis on job-specific vocabulary
- **N-gram Analysis**: Bi-gram and tri-gram patterns for job description language
- **Semantic Embeddings**: WebLLM-generated content embeddings for similarity analysis
- **Linguistic Features**: Sentence structure, readability scores, professional language indicators

**Structural Features:**
- **HTML Element Analysis**: Presence of specific tags (job schema markup, structured data)
- **Page Layout Indicators**: Content length, section organization, form elements
- **URL Pattern Analysis**: Career page indicators, job ID patterns, platform-specific formats

**Behavioral Features** (Based on research findings):
- **Missing Information Patterns**: Incomplete company details, vague job descriptions
- **Exaggeration Indicators**: Unrealistic salary ranges, excessive superlatives
- **Credibility Markers**: Contact information completeness, application process clarity

### Classification Model Architecture

**Primary Model**: Hybrid approach combining rule-based and ML classification
```typescript
interface ClassificationModel {
  ruleBasedScore: number;      // Traditional pattern matching (0.0-1.0)
  mlConfidenceScore: number;   // Machine learning prediction (0.0-1.0)
  webllmValidation: number;    // WebLLM semantic analysis (0.0-1.0)
  finalScore: number;          // Weighted combination
  classification: 'job_posting' | 'non_job' | 'expired' | 'low_quality';
}
```

**Training Data Sources:**
- Existing database of validated job postings
- Manually labeled non-job content samples
- Expired job posting detection dataset
- Cross-platform job posting variations

**PLAN_UNCERTAINTY**: Initial training data may be limited. Consider implementing active learning where uncertain classifications are flagged for manual review and added to training set.

### Performance Requirements

**Accuracy Targets:**
- Job vs Non-Job Classification: >90% accuracy
- Expired Job Detection: >85% accuracy  
- Content Quality Assessment: >80% accuracy
- Processing Time: <2 seconds per URL
- False Positive Rate: <5% for legitimate job postings

---

## 3. Expired/Inactive Job Detection Mechanisms

### Multi-Signal Detection System

**Direct Indicators:**
- **Posted Date Analysis**: Jobs older than 60-90 days flagged for review
- **Application Status**: "Applications closed", "Position filled" text detection
- **URL Status**: 404 errors, redirect to general career pages
- **Page Content Changes**: Removal of application buttons, contact information

**Indirect Indicators:**
- **Content Staleness**: Outdated technology requirements, obsolete qualifications
- **Company Changes**: Acquired companies, closed offices, layoffs
- **Market Context**: Position requirements not matching current market needs

**Implementation Strategy:**
```typescript
interface ExpirationDetection {
  isExpired: boolean;
  confidence: number;
  indicators: {
    postingAge: number;           // Days since posted
    applicationStatus: string;    // Open/Closed/Unknown
    urlAccessibility: boolean;    // Still reachable
    contentStaleness: number;     // Outdated content score
    companyStatus: string;        // Active/Acquired/Unknown
  };
  detectionMethod: string[];      // Methods used for detection
  lastChecked: Date;
}
```

### Integration with Existing Services

**RepostingDetectionService Enhancement:**
- Track job posting lifecycle across multiple checks
- Detect when active postings become inactive
- Historical analysis of posting patterns

**Automated Monitoring System:**
- Periodic re-validation of previously analyzed jobs
- Notification system for status changes
- Database updates for expired content

## 4. URL Validation and Accessibility Checking

### Comprehensive Validation Pipeline

**Pre-Processing Validation:**
- URL format normalization and sanitization
- Protocol validation (HTTP/HTTPS requirements)
- Domain reputation checking via DNS lookup
- Malicious URL detection using security databases

**Accessibility Validation:**
```typescript
interface AccessibilityCheck {
  httpStatus: number;
  responseTime: number;
  contentLength: number;
  contentType: string;
  serverInfo: string;
  redirects: RedirectInfo[];
  sslCertificate: SSLInfo;
  robotsTxtCompliance: boolean;
  accessibilityScore: number;
}
```

**Advanced Validation Features:**
- **JavaScript Rendering**: Detection of dynamic content requirements
- **Anti-Bot Detection**: Identification of CAPTCHA, rate limiting, IP blocking
- **Content Delivery**: CDN detection, geographic restrictions
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Responsive design validation

**PLAN_UNCERTAINTY**: Some job boards implement sophisticated anti-bot measures that may interfere with automated validation. Consider implementing gradual backoff strategies and user-agent rotation.

### Error Handling and Recovery

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Fallback to cached content when live validation fails
- Alternative URL discovery through site search
- Manual review flagging for persistent failures

**Retry Mechanisms:**
- Exponential backoff for temporary failures
- Multiple validation attempts with different configurations
- Health monitoring for validation service reliability

**Enhanced Validation Pipeline:**
```typescript
class EnhancedJobFieldValidator extends JobFieldValidator {
  async validateWithContentClassification(
    input: EnhancedValidationInput
  ): Promise<EnhancedAgentOutput> {
    // Tier 1: URL and accessibility validation
    const accessibilityResult = await this.validateURLAccessibility(input);
    if (!accessibilityResult.isAccessible) {
      return this.createFailureResponse('URL_INACCESSIBLE');
    }
    
    // Tier 2: Content type classification  
    const classification = await this.classifyContent(input);
    if (classification.primaryCategory !== 'job_posting') {
      return this.createNonJobResponse(classification);
    }
    
    // Tier 3: Job-specific validation with existing WebLLM
    return this.validateWithWebLLM(input);
  }
}
```

### Database Schema Extensions
