## Analysis Algorithm v0.1

### Current Risk Factors
1. **Posting Age:** Jobs posted for 45+ days
2. **Language Patterns:** Urgent hiring language ("immediate", "urgent")
3. **Salary Vagueness:** "Competitive salary" without specific ranges
4. **Description Quality:** Minimal specific requirements or very short descriptions
5. **Corporate Buzzwords:** Excessive use of "fast-paced", "dynamic"
6. **Title Analysis:** Overly long or generic job titles

### Scoring Methodology
- **Base Score:** 0.0 (legitimate)
- **Risk Accumulation:** Each factor adds weighted probability
- **Risk Levels:** 
  - Low: 0-39% ghost probability
  - Medium: 40-69% ghost probability  
  - High: 70-100% ghost probability

## User Experience Flow

1. **Job Submission:** User pastes job posting URL
2. **Data Extraction:** System scrapes and normalizes job content
3. **Analysis Processing:** AI algorithm evaluates authenticity indicators
4. **Results Display:** Real-time risk assessment with detailed breakdown
5. **History Access:** Universal analysis history across all sessions
