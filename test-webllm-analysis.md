# Test Enhanced WebLLM Analysis

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

1. **Missing WebLLM Package**: Installed `@mlc-ai/web-llm@0.2.79`
2. **Environment Configuration**: Added AI agent settings to `.env.local`
3. **Frontend Components**: Added "AI Investigative Analysis" tab to JobReportModal
4. **TypeScript Types**: Updated JobAnalysis interface with metadata.rawData.detailedAnalysis
5. **WebLLM Integration**: Fixed imports and API compatibility

## üß™ How to Test the Enhanced Analysis

### Step 1: Verify Environment
Check that `.env.local` contains:
```env
AGENT_ENABLED=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_ENABLED=true
AGENT_USE_SERVER_FALLBACK=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_USE_SERVER_FALLBACK=true
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_groq_api_key_here
```

### Step 2: Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test Job Analysis
1. Navigate to the application
2. Submit a job URL for analysis (try the Light & Wonder example)
3. Wait for analysis to complete
4. Click on the job title in the results table to open the detailed modal

### Step 4: Look for Enhanced Analysis Tab
In the JobReportModal, you should see **3 tabs**:
- **Ghost Analysis** (original basic analysis)
- **AI Investigative Analysis** (NEW - enhanced WebLLM analysis) ‚≠ê
- **Parsing Intelligence** (parsing metadata)

### Step 5: Verify Detailed Analysis Content
The "AI Investigative Analysis" tab should display:

1. **üß† AI Thought Process**
   - Step-by-step reasoning with numbered steps
   - "Thought for 15s" timing estimates
   - Multi-step analytical process

2. **üåê External Verification**
   - Links checked (company websites, job boards)
   - Platform status (accessible/blocked/not_found)
   - Confidence scores for each verification
   - Specific findings for each link

3. **üè¢ Company Intelligence**
   - Company name and domain verification
   - Business context and recent activity
   - Location verification details
   - Overall legitimacy score

4. **üéØ Cross-Platform Analysis**
   - Platforms where job was found
   - Information consistency across platforms
   - Duplicate detection results
   - Posting pattern analysis

5. **‚úÖ Confidence Analysis**
   - Detailed confidence breakdown with visual bars
   - Separate scores for title, company, location, legitimacy
   - Overall reasoning quality assessment

6. **üìã Verification Steps**
   - Numbered action steps taken by AI
   - Results for each verification step
   - Confidence level for each step
   - Suggested next steps for users

7. **üìù Final Assessment**
   - Professional conclusion from AI analysis
   - Overall legitimacy determination

8. **‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Factors & ‚úÖ Legitimacy Indicators**
   - Side-by-side comparison
   - Specific evidence-based factors
   - Color-coded risk assessment

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If the "AI Investigative Analysis" tab doesn't appear:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify WebLLM package is installed: `npm list @mlc-ai/web-llm`
3. Ensure environment variables are set correctly
4. Check that the analysis has `metadata.rawData.detailedAnalysis` in the response

### If WebLLM fails to initialize:
1. Ensure your browser supports WebGPU (Chrome 94+, Edge 94+)
2. Check browser console for WebGPU errors
3. The system will automatically fall back to Groq API if WebLLM fails

### If detailed analysis is empty:
1. Verify Groq API key is valid
2. Check server logs for AI validation errors
3. Ensure the job analysis triggers the agent validation (low confidence scores)

## üéØ Expected Performance

The enhanced analysis should match the quality shown in your screenshots:
- **Detailed thought process** like a professional investigative analyst
- **Multi-step reasoning** with external verification
- **Company research** with business context and recent activity
- **Cross-platform validation** detecting duplicate postings
- **Actionable insights** for job seekers

The new system provides the same comprehensive analysis as your basic scraping tool, but integrated into the Ghost Job Detector with persistent storage and cross-browser synchronization.
