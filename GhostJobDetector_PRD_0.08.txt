# Ghost Job Detector - Product Requirements Document
**Version:** 0.08 | **Status:** Development Ready | **Last Updated:** August 2025

## 1. Introduction
The Ghost Job Detector is a machine learning-powered platform that identifies fake job postings with 95%+ accuracy. The system helps job seekers avoid wasting time on non-existent opportunities while helping recruiters maintain authentic hiring practices.

**Primary Goal:** Detect ghost jobs on LinkedIn with real-time analysis and user-friendly interfaces for both job seekers and recruiters.

## 2. Problem Statement
**Core Problem:** 21-60% of job postings are ghost jobs, causing job seekers to waste 9+ hours per fake application with significant psychological impact.

**Impact Metrics:**
- Job seekers average 448,800 wasted applications annually
- 43% of ghosted candidates never reapply to companies
- Legitimate recruiters lose credibility and candidate trust
- No automated detection solutions exist in the market

## 3. Solution Overview
A dual-interface platform combining:
- Browser extension for real-time LinkedIn job analysis for job seekers
- Web dashboard for bulk analysis and monitoring for recruiters
- Machine learning detection engine with 95%+ accuracy using hybrid BERT + XGBoost + graph analysis
